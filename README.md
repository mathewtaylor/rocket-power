ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Mathew and I love building web apps!

My main interests are web technologies, Amazon Web Services and building SaaS applications. My preferred development technology is Vue for front-end development and Node, PHP or dotnet for back-ends and APIs. I build using different frameworks depending on the technology I am using, to help take care of all the common development activities like CRUD etc... I also leverage on third party services when possible to manage the non-core application related aspects for things like user authentication, sending emails etc... As well as development I am keen on using automation and CI/CD.

You can check out some of the SaaS applications I have built below. Each one of these was written by me from start to finish and I still work on them when I have the time.
